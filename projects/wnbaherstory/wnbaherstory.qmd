wnbaherstory is an R package that provides historical data on the WNBA (Womenâ€™s National Basketball Association). The WNBA was founded in 1997 and since then has had a lot of changes from team re-locations to ownership changes to different players going in and out of the league. This package has data on team win rate, attendance, team location, and the top high scorers. All of this data is historical and can be traced from the beginning of the WNBA (1997) to the 2024 season. User can have the option to view historical data of all time, or user can put in parameters in each function to specify what years, players, or teams they want to specifically look at. We hope this package can not only answer historical questions about the WNBA but also allow for users to see how the league has changed and grown over time.

This unpublished R package was created as a final project for Programming in R with Professor Ben Baumer, at Smith College Fall 2024 in collaboration with Jane Loo and Alina Abdulina.
