Smith College Class of 2026

Double Major in Statistical & Data Sciences; Psychology 

Smith College Basketball, Team Captain

I am a senior at Smith College (Class of 2026), double majoring in Statistical & Data Sciences. I have a broad interests in data science, with experience in statistical modeling, data visualization, and machine learning, and I enjoy tackling complex problems with creative, data-driven solutions. While many of my projects have focused on sports analytics, I am equally motivated by the challenge of applying these skills across different domains.

My experience as a student-athlete has strengthened skills that translate directly into data science: teamwork, resilience, and the ability to perform under pressure. Just as I value contributing to a data project, I enjoy being part of a basketball team where everyone works toward something bigger than themselves, and I carry that same commitment to collaboration into everything I do.
