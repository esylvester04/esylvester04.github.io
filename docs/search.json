I have a broad interests in data science, with experience in statistical modeling, data visualization, and machine learning, and I enjoy tackling complex problems with creative, data-driven solutions. While many of my projects have focused on sports analytics, I am equally motivated by the challenge of applying these skills across different domains.\nMy experience as a student-athlete has strengthened skills that translate directly into data science: teamwork, resilience, and the ability to perform under pressure. Just as I value contributing to a data project, I enjoy being part of a basketball team where everyone works toward something bigger than themselves, and I carry that same commitment to collaboration into everything I do."

    "text": "wnbaherstory is an R package that provides historical data on the WNBA (Women’s National Basketball Association). The WNBA was founded in 1997 and since then has had a lot of changes from team re-locations to ownership changes to different players going in and out of the league. This package has data on team win rate, attendance, team location, and the top high scorers. All of this data is historical and can be traced from the beginning of the WNBA (1997) to the 2024 season. User can have the option to view historical data of all time, or user can put in parameters in each function to specify what years, players, or teams they want to specifically look at. We hope this package can not only answer historical questions about the WNBA but also allow for users to see how the league has changed and grown over time.\nThis unpublished R package was created as a final project for Programming in R with Professor Ben Baumer, at Smith College Fall 2024 in collaboration with Jane Loo and Alina Abdulina."
